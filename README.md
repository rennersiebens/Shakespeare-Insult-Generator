# Shakespeare-Insult-Generator
Generates Shakespear insults from a file.

Takes a file with 3 seperate columns. 
Each column is a different word that 
Shakespear has used in one of his plays. 
The cpp code reads in each column to a 
different vector than prints out a random 
insult such as "Thou artlese base-court	apple-john!"
The program also prints out 100 unique insults
to the consol and sorts them in alphabetical order.
Furthermore, the project saves 1000 insults in a file.
